# Ingredients
- 80g butter
- 12 scallops (with shell)
- 3 garlic
- 1 tsp chilli flakes (Espelette)
- 2 tsp olive oil
- parsley
- salt
- pepper

# Instructions
Heat the butter and olive oil with the pan over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and chilli to the pan. Salt and pepper slightly.
Let rest so that the flavors of the ingredients mix well.

Meanwhile, remove scallops from the shell, rinse them and dry them with paper.

Wash and brush empty shells.

Brown your scallops in a pan with a little butter, about 30 seconds on each side.

Fill the empty shells of your chilli-garlic-butter. Place a scallop in each shells and place them on a plate.

Bake about 3 or 4 minutes in a preheated oven at 200C to warm them up. Sprinkle with parsley, salt and pepper.
