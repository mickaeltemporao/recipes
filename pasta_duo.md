# Duo of pasta  
The pasta duo should be served together. Gnocchi could be bought instead, but it better homemade.
Step A should be done the day before. Step B and C should be performed in parallel.

## INGREDIENTS

Pasta 1: Gnochhi pomodoro
- 3 russel potatoes
- 2 tomatoes 
- canola oil
- salt
- basil
- parmesan
- red vinegar
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 cup of flour

Pasta 2: Tortelloni with peas and bacon
- fresh tortelloni (e.g., Olivieri, smoked mozzarela and proscuito) 
- 1/2 liter chicken broth
- 1 table spoon of butter
- 6 slices of bacon
- 150g of green peas
- parmesan
- wine vinegar
- fresh thyme

## DIRECTIONS

### A - Gnocchi preparation (the day before):
1) bake the russet potatoes with skin in water. Put the potatoes in cold water before heating up. Remove from fire when potatoes are perfectly soft (no resistance). Drain the water and remove potatoes. Put a new pot of water back to heat. 

2) puree the potatoes using either a ricer or a sieve. Don't use a fork or "masher" (should be absolutely not granular). The skin should be automatically removed by the ricer/sieve process. 

3) create a little mountain with the refined potato and make a well inside. Add the yolk, then add flour progressively while mixing. If the "potatoe dough" is still sticky after 1 cup, add additional flour to the mix. 

4) cut the dough in 5-6 parts. Roll in part to create a long tube of 1cm of diameter. Cut the tube into 1.5cm cylinders. Roll the cylinders to elipsoids.

5) add salt to the water and blanch the gnocchi by putting them in the boiling water. They should sink. Remove them from water when they go up. Plunge them in cold water. 

6) freeze the gnocchis for later use

### B - Gnocchi pomodoro:
1) cut the tomatoes in half and squeeze the seeds out of the tomatoes. Then grate the tomatoes on a grater. This should also remove the skin. 

2) add canola oil in a sate pan and sate the gnocchis (directly from the freezer). Add salt. The gnocchi should be slightly brown colored. 

3) remove the gnocchis from fire, and using the grater, grate the garlic on the gnocchis. Then put them back on fire and add the tomato liquid as well as the red vinegar

4) end up with fresh gatered parmesan and fresh basil

### C - Tortelloni peas/bacon:
1) take a first stove and put gatered parmesan all over the stove. Put it on low heat and only remove when the parmesan is brown colored. Keep the parmesan crust for the latest step

2) boil some water in a pot, and add the fresh tortelloni. Cook one minute below the al-dente suggested on the packaging.

3) meanwhile, in another stove, add the broth and the butter, and put on high fire. 

4) drain the tortelloni out of the water and add them in the borth. 

5) add the peas, bacon and thyme to the broth and keep on high fire. Boil the broth down until the sauce becomes more dense. 

6) serve the pasta with the parmesan crust on the top
