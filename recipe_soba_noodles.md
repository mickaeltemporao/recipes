# Sugar Snap Pea and Carrot Soba Noodles

A healthy, vibrant soba noodle recipe full of fresh springtime produce. Feel free to trade in other seasonal vegetables for the sugar snap peas, like chopped bell pepper. This recipe yields about six servings and the leftovers don't keep particularly well, so halve the ingredients if you're not serving a crowd.
## INGREDIENTS
Soba
6 ounces soba noodles
2 cups frozen organic edamame
10 ounces (about 3 cups) sugar snap peas or snow peas
6 medium-sized carrots, peeled
½ cup chopped fresh cilantro (about 2 handfuls)
¼ cup sesame seeds
Ginger-sesame sauce
¼ cup reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce
2 tablespoons quality peanut oil or extra-virgin olive oil
1 small lime, juiced
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon honey or agave nectar
1 tablespoon white miso
2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger
1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce or sriracha

## INSTRUCTIONS
To prepare the vegetables: Use a chef's knife to slice the peas in half lengthwise (or just roughly chop them). Slice the carrots into long, thin strips with a julienne peeler, or slice them into ribbons with a vegetable peeler.
To make the sauce: whisk together the ingredients in a small bowl until emulsified. Set aside.
Bring two big pots of water to a boil. In the meantime, toast the sesame seeds: Pour the sesame seeds into a small pan. Toast for about 4 to 5 minutes over medium-low heat, shaking the pan frequently to prevent burning, until the seeds are turning golden and starting to make popping noises.
Once the pots of water are boiling: In one pot, cook the soba noodles just until al dente, according to package directions (probably about 5 minutes), then drain and briefly rinse under cool water. Cook the frozen edamame in the other pot until warmed through (about 4 to 6 minutes) but before draining, toss the halved peas into the boiling edamame water and cook for an additional 20 seconds. Drain.
Combine the soba noodles, edamame, snap peas and carrots in a large serving bowl. Pour in the dressing and toss with salad servers. Toss in the chopped cilantro and toasted sesame seeds. Serve.
