    - Before cooking all your cookies you need to test your oven!
    - Start by cooking a small batch (2-4 cookies). When done, let these rest for 15-30 minutes and check if they are done. If you feel that they are too soft, add an extra minute to the next batch, until you find the perfect cooking time! It will vary depending on your oven! Undercooked is always better than overcooked. Don't get caught, but you will...
