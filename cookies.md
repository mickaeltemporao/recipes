# The Long Awaited Cookie Recipe

## INGREDIENTS
- 1 Cup Butter (225g)
- 1 Cup Bread Flour (T65; 150g) 
- 3/4 All Purpose Flour (T45) (or T65 only but use 1.75 Cups)
- 1.5 Tsp Kosher Salt
- 1 Tsp Baking Soda
- 1 Cup Dark Brown Sugar (125g)
- 1/2 Cup White Sugar (125g TODO: check if this weighs the same as 1 cup dark brown sugar)
- 2 Tsp Vanilla (18g)
- 1 Tsp Espresso Powder (3g)
- 1 Tsp Brown Rum (optional)
- 2 Eggs (1 Egg + 1 Egg Yolk = 75g)
- 1/2 Cup Semisweet Chocolate Chip Cookies (62.5g)
- 5 oz Dark Chocolate (100g)

## DIRECTIONS
0. Cook the butter until it turns golden brown. While the butter cooks, prepare #1 & #2.
1. **Flour Mix** combine in a separate bowl:
    - 1 Cup Bread Flour
    - 3/4 All Purpose Flour
    - 1.5 Tsp Kosher Salt
    - 1 Tsp Baking Soda
2. **Sugar Mix** combine in another separate bowl:
    - 1 Cup Dark Brown Sugar
    - 1/2 Cup White Sugar
    - 2 Tsp Vanilla
    - 1 Tsp Rum
    - 1 Tsp Espresso Powder
3. Add Baked butter to Sugar Mix and mix for 2 minutes
4. Add 1 Egg + 1 Egg Yolk to Sugar mix and mix for 5 minutes
5. Add Flour Mix to Sugar Mix and mix for 2 minutes
6. Add Chocolate and let rest for 1 hour. This should give you ~1kg of cookie dough.
7. Make nice 45g round cookie balls. 
  - Do not crush them. The heat from the oven will make them melt and turn into perfectly looking cookies!
  - You can freeze the cookie dough balls and only bake what you eat.
8. Set the oven at 350* Fahrenheit (180* Celsius). Do not put any cookie inside before 350.
9. Bake in the oven at 350* Fahrenheit (180* Celsius) for 10 to 12 minutes.
  - If this is the first time using your oven with this recipe read the [Benchmark](#Benchmark) section below.
10. When they are done, remove them from the oven and let them rest for 15 to 30 minutes and eat them all! 

### Benchmark 
Benchmark the baking time needed for your oven to bake perfect cookies.
- Set the oven at 350* Fahrenheit (180* Celsius) 
- Put 1 or 2 cookies on parchment paper.
- Bake for 10 to 14 minutes usually, start with 10 minutes and adjust gradually.
- Let them cool for 15 to 30 minutes and try them. 
- They should have a nice golden crust on the outside while the inside stays soft and chewy.
- If you feel that they are too soft, you should add an extra minute to the next batch until you find the perfect baking time that suits your oven and tastes! 
- Note that underbaked is always better than overbaked! Your cookies will turn stones when you've gone too far... Trust me you don't want that!
