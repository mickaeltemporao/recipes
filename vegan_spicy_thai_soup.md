- 1 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and sliced
- ¼ cup cilantro, stems only

- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

- 1 pound Chinese egg noodles
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon coconut sugar
- Kosher salt

## DIRECTIONS

1. Prepare lemongrass water by, placing the thinly sliced lemongrass in a small bowl, then pour ½ cup of boiling water over it and allow to steep for at least 10 minutes. Then remove the lemongrass, reserving the water.
2. Puree the chilies, shallots, garlic, ginger, cilantro stems, coriander, turmeric, curry, and 2 tablespoons of the lemongrass water. Process until smooth, add more lemongrass water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if needed.
3. In a large pot over medium heat, warm the vegetable oil. Add the spicy curry puree you just made, and cook 4-6 minutes, stirring constantly.
4. Add the coconut milk and broth. Bring to a boil and add the chicken. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the chicken until fork-tender, about 10-15 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and allow to cool slightly, then shred the meat.
5. Cook the noodles according to the package directions.
6. Add the fish sauce, coconut sugar, and chicken to the soup. Season with salt, if needed. Divide the soup and noodles among bowls and serve with the desired toppings. Enjoy!
