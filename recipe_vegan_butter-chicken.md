# Vegan Butter Chicken
## Ingredients
- 2 small yellow onion (or one large), chopped
- 1.25 cup low sodium vegetable broth
- 2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 cm fresh ginger
- 2 tablesp tandory paste
- garam masala,
- cinnamon
- cumin
- curcumin
- Chinese five spices
- 1/4 teasp cayenne pepper
- 2 tablesp mapple syrup
- 0.3 cup raw cashews + 3 tbsp to roast for garnish
- 500 ml chickpeas
- green onions
- 1x butter chicken sauce
    - or
- 3 cups plain tomato sauce

## Directions
1. Soak cashews in hot water while preparing the sauce.
2. On medium high heat, in a large pan, sauté the onions and garlic with the spices (ginger and cayenne pepper) in 0.25 cup of the vegetable broth until the onions are soft and the spices are fragrant.
3. Add the remaining vegetable broth (1 cup), plain tomato sauce and mapple syrup. Simmer for 5-8 minutes or so until fragrant.
4. Rinse your cashews, In a blender or in a separate deep bowl, blend ⅓ cup of raw cashews with about ⅓ cup of the butter chicken sauce that is simmering on the stove until creamy and smooth . I used a stick immersion blender and blended the soaked cashews with a bit of the sauce in a deep bowl. If you are using a high speed blender you may need to add in about ½ cup of the sauce with the cashews for it to blend well. Transfer the blended sauce back into the pan with the rest of the Butter Chicken sauce.
5. If using, in a separate pan, over medium high heat, roast 3 tbsps of cashews for 5 minutes in a pan (these are the cashews that you will use to garnish the butter chicken with).
6. Add the chickpeas to the pan. Simmer for an additional 5 - 10 minutes. Serve Butter Chicken over yellow rice pilafor basmati rice. Garnish with roasted cashews.

Optional: Garnish with roasted cashews and green onions.
