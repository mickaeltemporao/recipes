[Source](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/254946/chef-johns-hawaiian-style-ahi-poke/)

## INGREDIENTS

- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
- 1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions, plus more for serving
- 2 tablespoons crushed, roasted macadamia nuts
- 1 tablespoon finely crumbled dried seaweed
- 1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper flakess
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
- 1 pound sushi-grade ahi (yellowfin) tuna, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds

### Serve with:
Lemon juice, lime juice, or seasoned rice vinegar (optional)

## DIRECTIONS

1) Whisk soy sauce, sesame oil, grated ginger, sliced onions, macadamia nuts, seaweed, pepper flakes, and salt together in a bowl.
2) Place cubed tuna into bowl. Pour in marinade and stir to distribute evenly. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours. Mix again.
3) Serve topped with toasted sesame seeds, sliced green onions, and a sprinkle of lemon or lime juice, or seasoned rice vinegar.

### Footnotes

#### Cook's Note:
- Do not add vinegar or citrus juice to the marinade. You won't get the same texture that we're looking for here.
- I like to serve this on sushi rice with sliced seasonal vegetables. Other options include cold noodles, or on a salad, or with fried wonton chips as an appetizer.

#### Editor's Note:
- Consuming raw seafood may increase your risk of foodborne illness, especially if you have certain medical conditions.
