# BBQ Ribs

## Ingredients
- sea salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- 1.5kg ribs, membrane removed

### For the paste
- 5 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 dried chipotle
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1.5 teaspoons sweet paprika
- 1.5 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice
- 0.5teaspoon ground nutmeg

### For the rad rum BBQ sauce
- 4cm piece of ginger, peeled
- 4 cloves of garlic, peeled
- 125 ml tomato ketchup
- 60ml dark rum
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 3 tablespoons cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 0.5 teaspoon dried chilli flakes
- 50g soft dark brown sugar

## Directions
Combine the paste ingredients and 2 teaspoons of salt in a bowl.
Pat the ribs dry with kitchen paper, then place in a tray and rub all over with the paste.
Cover with cling film and leave to marinate in the fridge for 24h.

When you want to cook, remove the ribs from the fridge, shake off any excess marinade and allow to come up to room temperature.
Meanwhile, set up your barbecue for the half and half technique (so half the base is covered in charcoal and the other side is empty) – you want a medium indirect heat.
Place a drip tray inside the barbecue on the indirect side.
Cover with the lid and allow to heat up like an outdoor oven – you want a temperature of around 180°C/350°F.

Rip off just over an arm’s length of extra-strong tin foil, stack up the ribs in the centre and tightly wrap.
Place the foil parcel over indirect heat on the barbecue, cover with the lid and cook for around 2 hours, or until the meat is tender and starts to fall away from the bone, remembering to replenish with hot coals every 45 minutes or so.
Meanwhile, finely grate the ginger and garlic into a small pan on the hob.
Add the rest of the BBQ sauce ingredients and 80ml of water.
Simmer over a low/medium heat for until thickened (around ~60-90 minutes), stirring occasionally.
Season to taste and set aside.

Remove the ribs from the foil (after ~2h) and brush all over with the BBQ sauce and any cooking juices.
Return to the indirect heat for another 40-60 minutes with the lid on, or until tender and golden, basting well and turning sides every 10 minutes.
Remove to a board to rest for 5 minutes, then carve.
