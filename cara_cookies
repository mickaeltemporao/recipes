Anyhoo here’s the recipe:

Zest of 1 orange
1 large egg
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup old fashioned oats
1 stick unsalted butter, softened
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp grand marnier (optional)
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
1 cup chocolate chips (or chopped)
1/2 cup walnuts/pecans/whatever you already have at home
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
Salt

1. Cream butter and sugar. Add egg, vanilla extract and grand marnier, and mix well. 
2. In a separate bowl mix flour, salt, and baking soda. 
3. In batches add dry mixture to the wet mixture.
4. Add oats, orange zest, nuts and chopped chocolate. Mix well. (Feel free to mix by hand, and/or to eyeball/freestyle any of the ingredients!)
5. Using a cookie scoop or the hands God gave you, form approximately a dozen balls of dough. Flatten each ball JUST slightly before placing it on a greased cookie sheet. Sprinkle some salt.
6. Bake at 350F for 10-12 min.   Bon appétit!
