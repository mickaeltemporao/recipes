## Ingredients

- 1 Baby Eggplant 160 g
- 1 Fresh Mozzarella 125 g
- 1 Large Garlic Clove
- 1 Crushed Tomatoes
- 1 tbsp
- 370ml Crushed Tomatoes
- 3.75g Italian Seasoning
- 15ml Balsamic Vinegar
- 170 g Spaghetti
- 30g Green Olives
- Baby Spinach (1 Pack)

## Instructions
0. Preheat your broiler to high (to broil eggplant). Start prepping when the oven comes up to temperature! 
1. Wash and dry all produce.* In a large pot, add 12 cups water and 2 tsp salt. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. (NOTE: Use same size pot, water and salt amount for 4 ppl.) Meanwhile, roughly chop olives. Peel, then mince or grate garlic. Cut mozzarella into 1/2-inch rounds. Cut eggplant into 1/4-inch rounds. Season both sides with salt. Set aside.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together half the garlic, 1 tbsp vinegar (dbl for 4 ppl), 1 tsp Italian seasoning (dbl for 4 ppl) and 2 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl). Set aside. To the large pot, add spaghetti. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 10-12 min. When spaghetti is tender, drain and return to the same pot, off heat.
3. On a foil-lined baking sheet, arrange eggplant slices into a single layer. Brush both sides of eggplant slices with balsamic mixture from the small bowl, then top with mozzarella slices. Broil in middle of oven, until eggplant slices soften and mozzarella melts, 6-8 min.
4. Meanwhile, heat a medium pot over medium-high heat. When the pot is hot, add 1 tsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then remaining garlic and 2 tsp Italian seasoning (dbl for 4 ppl). Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 30 sec. Add crushed tomatoes and 1 tsp sugar (dbl for 4 ppl). Cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through, 2-3 min. Add olives and baby spinach. Cook, stirring often, until spinach wilts, 1-2 min. Season with salt and pepper.
5. To the large pot with spaghetti, add tomato sauce, then stir to coat. Divide spaghetti between plates, and serve with eggplant slices.
