## INGREDIENTS

- 2 cups sushi rice
- 2 cups water
- 4 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 tablespoons mirin
kelp, leaf (optional)

## DIRECTIONS

- Ignore the directions on the bag that the rice came from and rinse the rice only 3-5 times. The water does NOT have to run clear.

- Place rice to drain in a strainer.
- Drain for one hour in the winter, 30 min in the summer. (Sounds strange, but is true).

- While rice is draining, combine vinegar,sugar, salt and mirin together in a bowl and mix well.

- If using a kelp leaf, it should be about 2 in long.

- Wipe it lightly, cut small slits to make it look like a comb and add it to a pot along with the water.

- Add rice to the pot.

- Bring quickly to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.

- Cover the pot and DON'T touch it until the end, NO PEEKING.

- Cook for 15 minutes before removing the pot from the heat but keep the lid CLOSED.

- Let rice rest for 10 min and then remove the cover.

- Place in a glass dish to cool and lightly fan the rice while adding the vinegar mixture.

- Mix rice gently, careful not to break it.

- Sushi rice is best used at body temperature.
