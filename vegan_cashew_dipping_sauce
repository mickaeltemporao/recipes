# Cashew Dipping Sauce

![Original Recipe](https://minimalistbaker.com/quinoa-spring-rolls-with-cashew-dipping-sauce/)

## INGREDIENTS

### QUINOA
- 1 cup red or white quinoa, thoroughly rinsed
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce (or tamari for GF eaters)
- 1/2 lime, juiced

### FILLINGS
- 10 spring roll papers, pieces of sturdy greens, or lettuce boats/cups
- 1 cup each julienned cucumber, carrot, and red pepper
- 1 cup fresh herbs (cilantro + mint)

### CASHEW SAUCE
- 1/2 cup cashew butter (if unsalted, add additional soy sauce)
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce (or tamari for GF eaters)
- 3/4 tsp chili garlic sauce
- 2 Tbsp sweetener (i.e. maple syrup, agave, brown sugar, or honey if not vegan)
- 1/2 lime, juiced
- Hot water to thin

## DIRECTIONS
- Start by preparing quinoa. Heat a small saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add 1 Tbsp oil and quinoa and quick toast for 2-3 minutes. Then add 2 cups water, bring to a low boil, then reduce heat to low and cover. Cook for 15-20 minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed and it's light and fluffy in texture.
- Prep vegetables and herbs and set aside.
- Prepare cashew butter sauce by adding all sauce ingredients except water to a small mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Add enough hot water to thin until a pourable sauce is achieved. Adjust flavors as needed (I often add a little more chili garlic sauce and sweetener).
- To add more flavor to the quinoa, add 1 Tbsp soy sauce + 1/2 lime, juiced and toss to coat. Set aside.
- To assemble spring rolls, pour very hot water into a shallow dish or skillet and immerse rice paper to soften for about 10-15 seconds.
- Transfer to a damp cutting board or similar surface and gently spread out into a circle. It may take a little practice, so don’t feel bad if your first few attempts fail!
- To the bottom third of the wrapper add a generous spoonful of quinoa, and layer carrots, bell peppers, cucumber, and fresh herbs on top (see photo). Gently fold over once, tuck in edges, and continue rolling until seam is sealed.
- Place seam-side down on a serving platter and cover with damp warm towel to keep fresh. Repeat until all fillings are used up – about 8-10 spring rolls total.
- Serve with cashew butter sauce and sriracha or hot sauce of choice. I like to mix mine and go dip happy.
- Leftovers store well individually wrapped in plastic wrap, though best when fresh.
